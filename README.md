# Aerophane

Aerophane is a template for creating fast, light, responsive mobile apps in a browser based on Google's [Material Design](https://material.google.com/) principles.

## Purpose

Templates for mobile web and hybrid web (Cordova) applications are everywhere, but even the ones that advertise themselves as "lite" have major dependencies on additional frameworks, libraries, images, and fonts. I have found this bloat to be a significant hinderance to customization and portability. I desired an actually lightweight starting template for Cordova and online web apps that didn't bring too much baggage to the relationship.

## Speed

The many fancy features of most mobile web templates bog down responsiveness, especially as compared to native mobile applications. This had lead many to believe that to make smooth running mobile apps, native is the only option. This is a myth. Aerophane starts you with a blazing fast interface. I can't stop you from making your app sluggish after you add tons of gratuitous and dubious features, but at least it will be of your own making.

## Customization

Aerophane is design to be easy to add what you need and not restrict the ability to implement any reasonable features. Aerophane is true template, **not** a framework.

## Clean, Clear, Minimal, Semantic Code

There are no gratuitous divs and classes. The HTML used for the UI looks exactly like standard, valid HTML5 and is clearly readable from source.

## Platform Independent

Aerophane is intended to work well in both Android and iOS devices.
